Email relies on several protocols to send, receive, and store messages. The most important are:

## SMTP

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send emails from a client to a server or between servers.

## POP3

Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) allows users to download emails from the server to their local device and then delete them from the server.

## IMAP

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) lets users view and organize emails on the server, syncing across multiple devices.
