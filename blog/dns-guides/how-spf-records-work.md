Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses during the delivery of the email. In this guide, you'll learn:

- What SPF records are
- How to create and configure them
- Why they matter for deliverability

## What is an SPF Record?

An SPF record is a DNS TXT record that lists the mail servers allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.

## Creating an SPF Record

1. Log in to your DNS provider.
2. Add a new TXT record with the value:
   ```
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
   ```
3. Save and propagate changes.

## Why SPF Matters

SPF helps prevent spammers from sending messages with forged "From" addresses at your domain. This improves your deliverability and protects your brand.
