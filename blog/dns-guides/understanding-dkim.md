# Understanding DKIM: How Digital Signatures Protect Your Email

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication protocol that uses cryptographic signatures to verify that emails are genuine and unaltered.

---

## What is DKIM?
- DKIM adds a digital signature to email headers using a private key.
- Recipients use the public key (published in DNS) to verify the signature.
- Ensures message integrity and authenticates the sender’s domain.

---

## Why DKIM Matters
- Prevents spoofing and phishing attacks
- Improves deliverability and trust
- Required for DMARC compliance

---

## How DKIM Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Email server signs outgoing messages with a private key.
2. Signature is added to the email header (DKIM-Signature).
3. Recipient’s server retrieves the public key from DNS and verifies the signature.

---

## Example DKIM-Signature Header
```eml
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=example.com; s=selector1;
 h=from:to:subject:date:message-id;
 bh=47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=;
 b=abc123...
```

---

## Implementation Guide
1. Generate a DKIM key pair (public/private)
2. Publish the public key as a DNS TXT record
3. Configure your mail server to sign outgoing emails
4. Test using tools like MXToolbox or DKIMCore

---

## Key Takeaways
- DKIM is essential for email security and deliverability
- Always keep your private key secure
- Test your DKIM setup regularly
