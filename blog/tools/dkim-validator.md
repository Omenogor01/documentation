# DKIM Record Validator Tool

Welcome to our DKIM Record Validator tool! This powerful utility helps you verify DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) records for your domain. DKIM is essential for email authentication and preventing email spoofing.

## What is DKIM?

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication method that allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message in a way that can be verified by message recipients. It helps prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks.

## Features

- **DKIM Record Validation**: Check if your DKIM record is properly configured
- **Selector Support**: Validate DKIM records with different selectors
- **Syntax Checking**: Verify DKIM record syntax and format
- **Multiple Record Detection**: Detect and warn about multiple DKIM records
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with clear results

## Why Validate DKIM Records?

1. **Email Deliverability**: Proper DKIM configuration helps ensure your emails reach their intended recipients
2. **Security**: Prevents email spoofing and phishing attacks
3. **Compliance**: Many email providers require proper DKIM configuration
4. **Domain Reputation**: Maintains your domain's reputation for sending legitimate emails

## Common Issues

- Missing DKIM Record: Domain without DKIM record is vulnerable to spoofing
- Invalid Syntax: DKIM records must start with "v=DKIM1"
- Missing Required Tags: DKIM records must include "k" (key type) and "p" (public key) tags
- Length Limit: DKIM records cannot exceed 255 characters

## Best Practices

1. Always have a DKIM record for your domain
2. Use a strong public key (at least 1024 bits)
3. Keep the record under 255 characters
4. Use descriptive selectors (e.g., "mail", "smtp", "202401")
5. Test after making changes
6. Monitor email delivery rates
