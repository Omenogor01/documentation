# SPF Record Validator Tool

Welcome to our SPF Record Validator tool! This powerful utility helps you verify SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records for your domain. SPF records are crucial for email authentication and preventing email spoofing.

## What is SPF?

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses during the delivery of the email. It allows domain owners to specify which mail servers are permitted to send email on their behalf.

## Features

- **SPF Record Validation**: Check if your SPF record is properly configured
- **Syntax Checking**: Verify SPF record syntax and format
- **Multiple Record Detection**: Detect and warn about multiple SPF records
- **Length Validation**: Ensure SPF record doesn't exceed maximum length
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with clear results

## Why Validate SPF Records?

1. **Email Deliverability**: Proper SPF configuration helps ensure your emails reach their intended recipients
2. **Security**: Prevents email spoofing and phishing attacks
3. **Compliance**: Many email providers require proper SPF configuration
4. **Domain Reputation**: Maintains your domain's reputation for sending legitimate emails

## Common Issues

- **Multiple SPF Records**: Only one SPF record per domain is allowed
- **Invalid Syntax**: SPF records must start with "v=spf1"
- **Length Limit**: SPF records cannot exceed 255 characters
- **Missing SPF**: Domain without SPF record is vulnerable to spoofing

## Best Practices

1. Always have an SPF record for your domain
2. Keep the record under 255 characters
3. Use "-all" at the end for strict validation
4. Test after making changes
5. Monitor email delivery rates
