# DNSSEC Validator Tool

Welcome to our DNSSEC Validator tool! This powerful utility helps you verify DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) configuration for your domain. DNSSEC adds security to DNS by providing origin authentication and data integrity.

## What is DNSSEC?

DNSSEC is a security extension for DNS that:

1. **Authenticates**: Verifies DNS data comes from the correct source
2. **Integrity**: Ensures DNS data hasn't been modified
3. **Confidentiality**: Keeps DNS data private
4. **Non-repudiation**: Prevents DNS data from being denied

## Features

- **DNSSEC Status**: Check if DNSSEC is properly configured
- **Record Verification**: Validate DNSKEY and DS records
- **Key Analysis**: Check key signing and zone signing keys
- **Security Recommendations**: Get configuration suggestions
- **Detailed Results**: Show complete DNSSEC record information

## Why Validate DNSSEC?

1. **Security**: Protect against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning
2. **Authentication**: Verify DNS data authenticity
3. **Compliance**: Meet security requirements
4. **Trust**: Build trust in your domain's DNS data
5. **Monitoring**: Track DNSSEC configuration changes

## Common Use Cases

1. **Security Audits**: Verify DNSSEC configuration
2. **DNS Configuration**: Check DNSSEC setup
