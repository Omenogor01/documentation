# DMARC Record Validator Tool

Welcome to our DMARC Record Validator tool! This powerful utility helps you verify DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) records for your domain. DMARC is essential for email authentication and preventing email spoofing.

## What is DMARC?

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that helps protect your domain from unauthorized use. It builds on SPF and DKIM to:

1. Verify email authenticity
2. Provide reporting on email sending activity
3. Enable policy enforcement
4. Prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks

## Features

- **DMARC Record Validation**: Check if your DMARC record is properly configured
- **Policy Settings Analysis**: Analyze DMARC policy settings (p, rua, ruf)
- **Syntax Checking**: Verify DMARC record syntax and format
- **Multiple Record Detection**: Detect and warn about multiple DMARC records
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with clear results

## Why Validate DMARC Records?

1. **Email Deliverability**: Proper DMARC configuration helps ensure your emails reach their intended recipients
2. **Security**: Prevents email spoofing and phishing attacks
3. **Compliance**: Many email providers require proper DMARC configuration
4. **Domain Reputation**: Maintains your domain's reputation for sending legitimate emails
5. **Insight into Email Traffic**: Provides reports about email sending activity

## Common Issues

- **Missing DMARC Record**: Domain without DMARC record is vulnerable to spoofing
- **Invalid Syntax**: DMARC records must start with "v=DMARC1"
- **Missing Required Settings**: DMARC records must include policy (p), reporting URI (rua), and forensic URI (ruf)
- **Invalid Policy Settings**: Policy must be one of: none, quarantine, or reject
- **Multiple DMARC Records**: Only one DMARC record per domain is allowed

## Best Practices

1. Always have a DMARC record for your domain
2. Start with a "none" policy and gradually move to "quarantine" or "reject"
3. Use descriptive reporting URIs
4. Monitor DMARC reports regularly
5. Keep the record under 255 characters
6. Test after making changes
7. Use DMARC aggregators for better report analysis
