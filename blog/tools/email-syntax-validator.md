# Email Syntax Validator Tool

Welcome to our Email Syntax Validator tool! This powerful utility helps you verify the syntax and format of email addresses. Proper email syntax is crucial for email deliverability and system validation.

## What is Email Syntax?

Email syntax refers to the proper structure and format of an email address. A valid email address must:

1. Have a local part (before the @)
2. Have a domain part (after the @)
3. Follow specific character rules
4. Be within length limits
5. Use proper domain format

## Features

2. **System Integration**: Many systems require valid email format
3. **Data Quality**: Maintain clean contact data
4. **User Experience**: Prevent user input errors
